# My dotfiles.

Epic. Very epic dotfiles.
This is basically the same as [my previous repo](https://github.com/takase1121/dotfiles), but restructured.

The main thing I don't like about the previous repo is suprisingly chezmoi -
its too cumbersome to use (need to do `chezmoi edit` blabla instead of editing the file itself).
Instead I found [cdwilson's epic way of managing it](https://github.com/cdwilson/home) and adopted their structure instead.


### Used programs
- GNU Stow
- rxvt-unicode\*
- xterm\*
- qterminal\*
- kitty
- openbox
- picom (`next` branch)
- mpv
- xwinwrap ([my fork](https://github.com/takase1121/xwinwrap))
- tabbed (if you use xterm, rxvt is configured with tabbedex. [mine](https://github.com/takase1121/tabbed))
- nano
- chromium
- lxqt

> `*` means that I no longer use this program, so I might not update it

### Notes
- `CTRL-X` replaces `CTRL-C` in XTerm. This is intentional, check [this](https://github.com/csdvrx/CuteXterm)

### TODO
- locker (haven't decided)
